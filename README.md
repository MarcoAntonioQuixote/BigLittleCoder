### Helping students elevate their coding skills through collaborative learning and guided mentorship 🚀

To find out more, visit: [BigLittleCoder](https://www.biglittlecoder.com)

In this portfolio you'll find two directories - one for the front and backend. 

### *The Front End*

The front end consists of a few important parts:

1. `React Three Fiber` - renderings of a 3D enviornment and 3D characters that each have their own personality and are each assigned to a 'page' on the site.
2. `Porfolio of Games` - several porfolio projects some full stack some just front-end that show the creativity undergirding BigLittleCoder, what students can learn.
3. `Class Information` - the ability to find out more about our classes and sign up for a free taster session!
4. `Information on Mark Anthony` - Info on our founder and lead instructor.

### *The Backend*

The backend is simple: using the OpenAPI library, we make a call to ChatGTP to respond to user prompts in the voice of one of the little characters that brings the front-end to life.

### Mark Anthony Gutierrez | Founder
When Mark Anthony isn't helping students leap into the world of coding, he is probably: 
* Playing at a waterfall with his adventure buddy, Jamaica, a beautiful belgian shepard. 🐕
* Practicing a backflip, which Jamaica already knows how to do. 🤸🏽
* Building React Native games centered around bringing people together in fun and silly ways. 🕹️
* Taking a stab at the arts 🗡️
